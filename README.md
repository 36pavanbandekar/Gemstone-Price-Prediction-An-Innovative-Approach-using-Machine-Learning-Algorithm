Our task is to develop a predictive model using machine learning algorithms for Gem Stones co ltd, a cubic zirconia manufacturer. With a dataset of approximately 27,000 cubic zirconia stones and their respective attributes and prices, the company is interested in distinguishing between higher and lower profitable stones to improve their profit share. We need to predict the price of each stone based on the given details in the dataset to assist the company in identifying and focusing on high-profit stones.
